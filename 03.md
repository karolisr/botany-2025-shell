# Working with with commands/tools
One of the main reason that a lot of us uses command line is to use specific packages and softwares. This section will cover some basic but useful commands while working with command line tools.

## Identifying Commands

### `type` - Display a command's type
```console
fky:~$ type ls
ls is an alias for ls -G
fky:~$ type cd
cd is a shell builtin
```
### `which` - Display an Executable's Location
```console
fky:~$ which clear
/usr/bin/clear
fky:~$ which python3
/usr/local/bin/python3
```

## Getting a Command's Documentation
### `help` - Get help from shell builtins - exclusive for linux
```console
fky:~$ help cd
```

### `--help` - Display usage information
Most tools or packages written using standard CLI frameworks automatically support `--help/-h`.
```console
fky:~$ python3 --help

usage: /usr/local/bin/python3.10 [option] ... [-c cmd | -m mod | file | -] [arg] ...
Options and arguments (and corresponding environment variables):
-b     : issue warnings about str(bytes_instance), str(bytearray_instance)
         and comparing bytes/bytearray with str. (-bb: issue errors)
-B     : don't write .pyc files on import; also PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=x
-c cmd : program passed in as string (terminates option list)
-d     : turn on parser debugging output (for experts only, only works on
         debug builds); also PYTHONDEBUG=x
-E     : ignore PYTHON* environment variables (such as PYTHONPATH)
-h     : print this help message and exit (also -? or --help)
-i     : inspect interactively after running script; forces a prompt even
         if stdin does not appear to be a terminal; also PYTHONINSPECT=x
-I     : isolate Python from the user's environment (implies -E and -s)
......
```
Other varieties of the `--help` command
```bash
<package-command> --help
<package-command> -help
<package-command> -h
```
> [!TIP]
> `-h` can mean something else in different packages, so using `--help` is the safest choice if you don't remember.

### `man` - Display a program's manual page
```console
fky:~$ man cd
BUILTIN(1)                 General Commands Manual                BUILTIN(1)

......
fky:~$ man mkdir
MKDIR(1)                   General Commands Manual                  MKDIR(1)

NAME
     mkdir – make directories

SYNOPSIS
     mkdir [-pv] [-m mode] directory_name ...

DESCRIPTION
     The mkdir utility creates the directories named as operands, in the
     order specified, using mode “rwxrwxrwx” (0777) as modified by the
     current umask(2).
......
```
note - need to press `q` to quit the manual page.

> Usually, either `--help` or  `man` should work for a well-packaged tool.

### `apropos` - Display appropriate commands
```console
fky:~$ apropos partition
clmdist(1), clm dist(1)  - compute the distance between two or more partitions (clusterings). The distance that is computed can be any of split/join distance, variance of information, or Mirkin metric. clmdist is not in actual fact a program. This manual page documents the behaviour and options of the clm program when invoked in mode dist. The options -h, --apropos, --version, -set, --nop are accessible in all clm modes. They are described in the clm manual page
fdisk(8)                 - DOS partition maintenance program
gpt(8)                   - GUID partition table maintenance utility
pdisk(8)                 - Apple partition table editor
fdisk(8)                 - DOS partition maintenance program
gpt(8)                   - GUID partition table maintenance utility
pdisk(8)                 - Apple partition table editor
(END)
```
### `whatis` - Display one-line manual page descriptions
```console
fky:~$ whatis cd
cd(n)                    - Change working directory
fky:~$ whatis mkdir
mkdir(1)                 - make directories
```
## Other helpful commands for package usage
### `--version` - Display the installed version of the package
Usually, you can use either `--version` or `-v` to display the version. Like `-h`, sometimes `-v` might mean something else in a package, e.g. in python it means verbose. `--version` is a safer choice.
```console
fky:~$ python3 --version
Python 3.13.2
......
fky:~$ java --version
java 15.0.2 2021-01-19
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 15.0.2+7-27)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 15.0.2+7-27, mixed mode, sharing)
```
### `alias` - Rename the package command in your system
This is for renaming the command temporarily. This will work immediately in that terminal session, but it will disappear as soon as you close the terminal or open a new one. Because aliases set this way are stored only in the memory of the current shell session. They’re not persistent.
```console
fky:~$ type ll
ll not found
fky:~$ alias ll="ls -lah"
fky:~$ type ll
ll is an alias for ls -lah
...
fky:~$ unalias ll
fky:~$ type ll
ll not found
```

> [!TIP]
> To enable the same alias every time you reboot your system, save your `alias` command in your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`, depending on which shell you are using. Please be very careful when you are changing your `.rc` file, because it's a critical script that runs automatically every time a new shell session starts (for interactive shells). Mistakes in this file can be disruptive to shell usage.

# Setting Up the Environment

## What is _**shell**_?
A shell is a program that lets you interact with your computer’s operating system through commands.It's like a translator between you and the computer’s core (the kernel). You type a command → the shell interprets it → the system runs it → you see the result. The terminal/command-line we are using are a text-based interface of shell.

`Bash` stands for Bourne Again SHell. It's a command-line shell and scripting language commonly used on Linux and macOS. `zsh`is another shell, similar to Bash, is the default shell on macOS.

## What is the _**environment**_?
The shell maintains a body of information during our shell session called the _**environment**_. Programs use the data stored in the environment to determine facts about the system’s configuration. While most programs use configuration files to store program settings, some programs also look for values stored in the environment to adjust their behavior. Knowing this, we can use the environment to customize our shell experience. 

The shell stores two basic types of data in the environment; though, with bash, the types are largely indistinguishable. They are _**environment variables**_ and _**shell variables**_. _**Shell variables**_ are variables that only exist within your current shell. They are either defined by you in the current shell session, or automatically set by the shell itself or its startup scripts/configuration files. _**Environment variables**_ are those that are exported to be available to subprocesses started by the shell (e.g., scripts, programs). They are either from the configuration files or those that are exported from the current shell sessions.

## **Configuration**
When we log on to the system, the bash program starts and reads a series of configuration files called startup files, which define the default environment shared by all users. This is followed by more startup files in our home directory that define our personal environment. The exact sequence depends on the type of shell session being started. There are two kinds:

**A login shell session**: This is one in which we are prompted for our username and password. This happens when we first login in to our system or when we start a virtual console session (SSH or GUI terminal login). In a login shell session, it will usually load `.bash_profile` if bash, `.zprofile` if zsh, which sets environment variables and some other things. `.bash_profile`/`.zprofile` may also load `.bashrc`/`.zshrc`, which includes more personal settings, such as aliases. Both `.profile` and `.rc` files are _**configuration files**_.

**A non-login shell session**: This typically occurs when we launch a new terminal session in the GUI, i.e. opening a new terminal window. Non-login shells inherit the environment from their parent process, usually a login shell. In a non-login shell session, it will only load `.bashrc` for bash and `.zshrc` for zsh.

> [!TIP]
> Remember because most of the configuration filenames listed start with a period (meaning that they are hidden), we will need to use the `-a` option when using `ls`.

This is why setting aliases in the terminal session is temporal. The setting needs to be in a configuration file to work for every shell session. Basically any changes you made to the environment in the current shell session will not apply to the future sessions unless they are saved in the _**configuration files**_.


## Viewing shell and enviroment variables with `printenv`, `set`, `echo`, and `export`
`printenv` will only display environment variables, while `set` will display both shell and environment variables. You can see that `printenv` and `set` output different list of variables below.
```console
fky:~$ printenv
__CFBundleIdentifier=com.apple.Terminal
TMPDIR=/var/folders/44/wzzp9dzs31v_2wbx_96mn2qr0000gn/T/
XPC_FLAGS=0x0
LaunchInstanceID=905F4111-B673-4A34-90D1-35BFDD64568B
TERM=xterm-256color
DISPLAY=/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.OhmBGOCU7J/org.xquartz:0
SECURITYSESSIONID=186a2
SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.Wp8d9kc6P1/Listeners
XPC_SERVICE_NAME=0
USER=fky
...
```
```console
fky:~$ set
'!'=674
'#'=0
'$'=638
'*'=(  )
-=569JNRXZghiklms
0=-zsh
'?'=0
@=(  )
ARGC=0
BG
CDPATH=''
COLUMNS=90
CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV=base
...
```
The `printenv` command can also list the value of a specific variable, but you cannot use the `set` command the same way.
```console
fky:~$ printenv USER
fky
```
It is also possible to view the contents of a variable using the echo command.
```console
fky:~$ echo $USER
fky
```
`export` can define and promote a shell variable to be an environment variable.
```console
fky:~$ myvar=hello           # shell variable
fky:~$ export myvar          # becomes environment variable
fky:~$ export othervar=hi    # define and export in one step
fky:~$ export -p             # show exported variables
```
> However, the exported environment variable only works in the current shell session, unless the `export` command is saved in a configuration file.

> [!TIP]
> Aliases are neither shell nor environment variable, thus cannot be shown by `set`, `printenv`, or `echo`, but you can display the list of aliases by entering the `alias` command without arguments.
```console
fky:~$ alias
-='cd -'
...=../..
....=../../..
.....=../../../..
......=../../../../..
1='cd -1'
...
```

| Command     | Purpose                                      | Shows Shell Vars? | Shows Env Vars? | Modifies Env Vars? | Common Use Case                        |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|-------------------|------------------|---------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `printenv`  | Print environment variables, all or a specific one                   | ❌                | ✅               | ❌                  | See variables like `PATH`, `HOME`      |
| `export`    | Mark shell variables as environment variables | ✅ (in list)       | ✅               | ✅                  | Export shell vars so subprocesses can see them |
| `echo`      | Print the value of any one variable               | ✅                | ✅               | ❌                  | Check the value of a specific var (`echo $PATH`) |
| `set`       | List all variables and functions        | ✅                | ✅               | ❌                  | View all variables, debug shell state  |


### Other useful variables to know about:
| Variable  | Contents|
| ------------- | ------------- |
|`SHELL`| The name of your shell program. |
|`HOME`| The pathname of your home directory. |
|`LANG`| Defines the character set and collation order of your language. |
|`OLDPWD`| The previous working directory. |
|`PAGER`| The name of the program to be used for paging output. This is often set to /usr/bin/less. |
|`PATH`| A colon-separated list of directories that are searched when you enter the name of a executable program. |
|`PS1`| Stands for “prompt string 1.“ This defines the contents of the shell prompt. |
|`PWD`| The current working directory. |
|`TERM`| The name of your terminal type. Unix-like systems support many terminal protocols; this variable sets the protocol to be used with your terminal emulator. |
|`TZ`| Specifies your time zone. Most Unix-like systems maintain the computer’s internal clock in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and then display the local time by applying an offset specified by this variable. |
|`USER`| Your username. |

## `PATH`
`PATH` is a colon-separated list of directories that are searched when you enter the name of a executable program. Folks frequently use `echo` to show what is in their `PATH`.
```console
fky:~$ echo $PATH
/home/fky/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/
```

What you should and should not do with `PATH`:

✅ Move downloaded executables to `\usr\local\bin`

If you downloaded a new executable to run in the terminal instead of installing it, it probably needs to be run as:
```console
fky:~$ /path/to/the/folder/my-program
```
However, it would be much easier to use if you move the executable to `\usr\local\bin`, which should be already in your `PATH`.
```console
fky:~$ mv /path/to/the/folder/my-program \usr\local\bin
```
Then you can use the executable by calling it directly, no matter which folder you are currently in.
```console
fky:~$ my-program
```
> [!TIP]
> Moving executables to other folders in your PATH can cause problems, so make sure you are only moving stuff into `\usr\local\bin`.

✅Add Custom Directories to `PATH`

If you have custom scripts or binaries, add their directory to `PATH`.

```console
fky:~$ export PATH="/path/to/the/folder/botany-2025-shell:$PATH"
```
Only running this command in your terminal is not going to change your `PATH` for every shell session. You would need to add this line to your shell configuration files (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, or `~/.zshrc`) to achieve that.

However, it is not recommanded to make your `PATH` longer unless it's necessary. The best approach is to move your executables to `\usr\local\bin`, compared to extending your `PATH`.

✅ Reload Shell after modifying `PATH`

After modifying your `PATH` variable in your configuration files, your `PATH` variable is not updated in the shell until you reload your shell. You could check the location of your executables and `PATH` with:
```console
fky:~$ which <command_name>
fky:~$ echo $PATH
```
To update your `PATH` variable, you can close the current shell and open a new one. Or you can use source to reload the `.rc` file to update your `PATH` variable.
```console
fky:~$ source ~/.bashrc
```

✅ Use Absolute Paths for System-Wide Modifications

When updating your `PATH` variable, always use absolute paths to avoid confusion.
> E.g. When you are in the `/Users/fky/` directory, `./Desktop/` is a relative path of the absolute path `/Users/fky/Desktop/`.

❌ Don't Add . (Current Directory) to PATH

Adding `.` to `PATH` (or using `export PATH=".:$PATH"`) is a security risk because a random or malicious script in your current directory could be executed unintentionally.

❌ Don't Make PATH Too Long

Excessively long PATH values slow down command execution and may cause conflicts.

❌ Don't Remove Essential System Directories
Never do:
```console
fky:~$ export PATH="/custom/bin"
```
This overwrites PATH, removing system directories, which can make basic commands (like ls, cd, or bash) unavailable.

## Conda Environment

### Why `conda`?
Using `conda` in bioinformatics is highly beneficial because it simplifies package management, dependency resolution, and environment control, which are crucial in scientific computing. 
 - Conda provides a simple way to install and manage packages from channels like bioconda, which hosts thousands of bioinformatics tools.
 - Many bioinformatics tools require specific versions of dependencies. Conda allows you to create isolated environments, preventing conflicts between tools and also conflicts among different users of the same machine.

### Anaconda vs Miniconda

| Feature           | Anaconda                          | Miniconda                         |
|------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Size**        | Large (~500MB)                 | Small (~40MB)                  |
| **Includes**    | Conda, Python, and 100s of preinstalled packages (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, etc.) | Only Conda and Python (minimal setup) |
| **Best for**    | Users who want a ready-to-use data science environment | Users who prefer a lightweight setup and install packages as needed |
| **Installation Time** | Longer due to preinstalled packages | Faster due to minimal installation |
| **Flexibility**  | Less flexible (comes with many packages by default) | More flexible (you choose which packages to install) |
| **Package Management** | Uses Conda package manager | Also uses Conda package manager |
| **System Resource Usage** | Higher (more packages and dependencies) | Lower (minimal setup) |
| **Default Channels** | Defaults to Anaconda’s official repository | Defaults to Anaconda’s repository but can use other sources |
| **Usage Scenario** | Ideal for beginners or those who want a fully-featured data science environment out-of-the-box | Ideal for experienced users who want a lightweight setup and control over installed packages |

### Where to start with `conda`?
Conda is pretty straghtforward to [install](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) and has clear, easy-to-start [tutorials](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html) on their website.

# Connecting with Remote Hosts

## What is a remote host?
Unix-like operating systems have had the capability to be administered remotely via a network. This allows users to access high performance computing without physically manipulating bulky computers. Thus, accessing remote hosts is an essential ability to have with regards to command line.

## Checking network connection and remote host IP
8.8.8.8 is the primary IP address for Google's public DNS server. It's common to use it to check network connection in the shell.
```console
fky:~$ ping 8.8.8.8
PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=0 ttl=115 time=26.479 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=115 time=17.021 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=115 time=194.726 ms
...
```
Do <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to interrupt this process.

You can also use `ping` to check if the ip of your server exist and that it is connected to the network.
```console
fky:~$ ping 172.236.228.250
PING 172.236.228.250 (172.236.228.250): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 172.236.228.250: icmp_seq=0 ttl=51 time=179.616 ms
64 bytes from 172.236.228.250: icmp_seq=1 ttl=51 time=236.965 ms
64 bytes from 172.236.228.250: icmp_seq=2 ttl=51 time=272.882 ms
64 bytes from 172.236.228.250: icmp_seq=3 ttl=51 time=254.139 ms
...
```

## Connect to remote hosts with `ssh`
Secure Shell (SSH) is the standard command to use to connect to remote hosts. It will ask for a password for the remote host:
```console
fky:~$ ssh botany@172.236.228.250
botany@172.236.228.250's password:
```
Example screen for a successful login
```console
fky:~$ ssh botany@172.236.228.250
botany@172.236.228.250's password:

botany@localhost:~$
```
Part of what happens when you establish a connection with a remote host via SSH is that an encrypted tunnel is created between the local and remote systems. Then you can use the shell on the remote host like using the terminal on your local laptop.

To disconnect from the remnote host
```console
botany@localhost:~$ exit
logout
Connection to 172.236.228.250 closed.
```

## `scp`
The OpenSSH package also includes programs that can make use of an SSH-encrypted tunnel to copy files across the network. `scp` (secure copy) is used much like the familiar cp program to copy files. The most notable difference is that the source or destination pathnames may be preceded with the name of a remote host, followed by a colon character.

> [!TIP]
> You cannot use `scp` when you are logged onto the remote server

Copying files from remote to local, local to remote, remote to remote. You would need to enter password of the remote server to run the command.
```console
fky:~$ scp <username>@<server-ip>:/path_to_the_file_to_copy /path_of_the_local_folder_to_save
fky:~$ scp /path_of_the_local_folder_to_copy <username>@<server-ip>:/path_to_the_folder_to_save
fky:~$ scp <username>@<server-ip>:/path_to_the_folder_to_copy <username>@<server-ip>:/path_of_the_local_folder_to_save
```
Example:
```console
fky:~$ scp examplefiles/intro_to_CLI/chloro/accD.txt botany@172.236.228.250:/home/botany/scp_example/
```

**Other commonly used options of `scp`**
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-r`   | Recursively copy directories and their contents. |
| `-C`   | Enable compression for faster transfers. |
| `-v`   | Enable verbose output to debug connection issues. |
| `-q`   | Suppress non-error output (quiet mode). |
| `-l`   | Limit bandwidth usage in Kbit/s (e.g., `-l 1000`). |
| `-p`   | Preserve file attributes such as timestamps and permissions. |
| `-B`   | Run in batch mode, preventing password prompts. |

## `rsync`
Similar to `scp`, `rsync` is a fast and versatile file-copying tool commonly used for synchronizing files and directories between local and remote systems. It minimizes data transfer by only copying differences between source and destination.

It is commonly used for backups, incremental file transfers, and efficient remote synchronization.

```console
fky:~$ rsync -avzP file.txt <username>@<server-ip>:/path_to_the_file_to_copy
```
**Commonly used options of `rsync`**
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-a`   | Archive mode (preserves symbolic links, permissions, timestamps, etc.). |
| `-v`   | Verbose output (shows detailed progress). |
| `-z`   | Enable compression to speed up transfers. |
| `-r`   | Recursively copy directories (included in `-a`). |
| `--partial`   | Keep partially transferred files for resuming. |
| `--progress` | Display real-time transfer progress. |
| `-P`   | Combines `--progress` and `--partial` (resume interrupted transfers). |
| `-e "ssh"` | Use SSH for secure file transfers. |
| `--delete` | Delete files in the destination that no longer exist in the source. |
| `--exclude="pattern"` | Exclude files matching a pattern (e.g., `--exclude="*.log"`). |
| `--include="pattern"` | Include specific files in transfer despite exclusions. |
| `--dry-run` | Show what would happen without actually copying files. |
| `-n`   | Alias for `--dry-run`. |
| `-u`   | Skip files that are newer in the destination. |
| `--bwlimit=RATE` | Limit bandwidth usage (e.g., `--bwlimit=1000` for 1MB/s). |
| `--checksum` | Compare files using checksums instead of timestamps. |

## Compare `scp` and `rsync`

| Feature         | `rsync` | `scp` |
|---------------|--------|------|
| **Transfer Method** | Uses **delta transfer** (only transfers changed parts of files). | Transfers **entire files** every time. |
| **Speed Efficiency** | Faster for repeated transfers due to incremental copying. | Slower as it copies everything, even unchanged files. |
| **Preserving Metadata** | Preserves file attributes (`-a` for archive mode). | Partially preserves timestamps and permissions (`-p`). |
| **Resuming Transfers** | Can resume interrupted transfers (`-P` or `--partial`). | Cannot resume; must restart the transfer. |
| **Progress Display** | Can show detailed progress (`--progress`). | No built-in progress display. |
| **Exclusion Rules** | Allows excluding specific files or directories (`--exclude`). | No built-in exclusion support. |
| **Syncing Files** | Deletes destination files that don’t exist in the source (`--delete`). | Only copies; does not sync differences. |
| **Usage Scenario** | Best for **backups, syncing directories, and large file transfers**. | Best for **simple, one-time file transfers**. |

## Downloading files from the web and FTP sites with `wget`
Single files, multiple files, and even entire sites can be downloaded with `wget`.
```console
fky:~$ wget --help
GNU Wget 1.25.0, a non-interactive network retriever.
Usage: wget [OPTION]... [URL]...

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

Startup:
  -V,  --version                   display the version of Wget and exit
  -h,  --help                      print this help
  -b,  --background                go to background after startup
  -e,  --execute=COMMAND           execute a `.wgetrc'-style command

Logging and input file:
  -o,  --output-file=FILE          log messages to FILE
  -a,  --append-output=FILE        append messages to FILE
  -d,  --debug                     print lots of debugging information
...
```

### `FTP`
FTP (File Transfer Protocol) is a standard network protocol used to transfer files between a client and a server over a TCP/IP network, such as the internet. NCBI genomes can be downloaded with FTP: https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/026/745/355/GCF_026745355.1_EL10.2/


You can use `wget` to download data from FTP sites. Note to do that, the URL of FTP sites needs to start with `ftp://` instead of `https://`.
```console
fky:~$ wget ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/GCF/026/745/355/GCF_026745355.1_EL10.2/README_GCF_026745355.1-RS_2023_06
```
