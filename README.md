### Now that you've opened your terminal..
Try typing or copying and pasting these lines into the terminal window.
```
STR="Hello world!"
echo $STR
```
This step sets the variable called `STR` to equal (`=`) the string of characters `Hello world!`. Then, we can `echo` the contents of this variable by using `$` to specify that we are calling a variable. 
* What happens if you put other text into `STR`?
* Try setting a different variable like `NAME`?
* What happens if you forget to use `$`?

Ideas of things to talk about

Alexa:
computer basics and file basics
file navigation and setup
cd, ls, path, aliases, git
basic commands
echo, cat, git, touch
nano, >, >>
programs for analysis
—help, -help -version
Simple grep and sed
Connecting to servers
ssh, wget, curl, screen
Bash scripting
Loops, loops over folders, for/while (a bit of awk)
How to google a problem
Thought processes behind finding information
Stackoverflow
man
Keyi:
Navigation - pwd, cd, ls
Manipulating files and directories - less, file, cp, mv, mkdir, rm
Setup -  path, configuration, conda environment
Working with commands - help, man, alias, etc.
Redirection - cat, sort, grep, etc.
Connecting with servers - ssh, wget, rsync, scp
Regular expression
Bash scripting
Using google and/or genAI to learn and debug

Karolis, not listing previously listed, relatively comfortable with all of them:
Redirection: 2>, 2>&1, &>
Environmental variables, manipulation: VAR=”...”, substitution  ${VAR}, env
head, tail (especially -f option)
Running processes (and manipulation): ps, kill, top, htop, btop
Background processes: CTRL+Z, bg, fg
Pipes: “|”
Program options (flags): common flags for help, version, etc. And how to learn a new program.
Find files: find and locate.
