## First steps

Before attending class, we request first that you attempt to open a terminal window.
From here, you'll be prepared for the class. 
Goal: open a terminal window and print a simple 'hello world'.

### Now that you've opened your terminal...

Try typing or copying and pasting these lines into the terminal window.

```bash
STR="Hello world!"
echo $STR
```

Quick explanation: 

This step sets the variable called `STR` to equal (`=`) the string of characters `Hello world!`. Then, we can `echo` the contents of this variable by using `$` to specify that we are calling a variable.


Questions to think about:
- What happens if you put other text into `STR`?
- What if you try setting a different variable like `NAME`?
- What happens if you forget to use `$`?

## Conclusions

Please reach out if you have issues with opening a terminal window, or if you got confused.
