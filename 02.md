# Working with with commands/tools
One of the main reason that a lot of us uses command line is to use specific packages and softwares. This section will cover some basic but useful commands while working with command line tools.

## Identifying Commands

### `type` - Display a command's type
```console
fky:~$ type ls
ls is an alias for ls -G
fky:~$ type cd
cd is a shell builtin
```
### `which` - Display an Executable's Location
```console
fky:~$ which clear
/usr/bin/clear
fky:~$ which python
python: aliased to /usr/local/bin/python3.10
```

## Getting a Command's Documentation
### `help` - Get help from shell builtins - exclusive for linux
```console
fky:~$ help cd
```

### `--help` - Display usage information
Most tools or packages written using standard CLI frameworks automatically support `-h/--help`.
```console
fky:~$ python --help

usage: /usr/local/bin/python3.10 [option] ... [-c cmd | -m mod | file | -] [arg] ...
Options and arguments (and corresponding environment variables):
-b     : issue warnings about str(bytes_instance), str(bytearray_instance)
         and comparing bytes/bytearray with str. (-bb: issue errors)
-B     : don't write .pyc files on import; also PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=x
-c cmd : program passed in as string (terminates option list)
-d     : turn on parser debugging output (for experts only, only works on
         debug builds); also PYTHONDEBUG=x
-E     : ignore PYTHON* environment variables (such as PYTHONPATH)
-h     : print this help message and exit (also -? or --help)
-i     : inspect interactively after running script; forces a prompt even
         if stdin does not appear to be a terminal; also PYTHONINSPECT=x
-I     : isolate Python from the user's environment (implies -E and -s)
......
```
Other varieties of the `-h` command
```bash
<package-command> --help
<package-command> -help
<package-command> -h
```

### `man` - Display a program's manual page
```console
fky:~$ man cd

MKDIR(1)                   General Commands Manual                  MKDIR(1)

NAME
     mkdir – make directories

SYNOPSIS
     mkdir [-pv] [-m mode] directory_name ...

DESCRIPTION

     order specified, using mode “rwxrwxrwx” (0777) as modified by the
     current umask(2).

note - need to press `q` to quit the manual page.

### `apropos` - Display appropriate commands
```console
fky:~$ apropos partition
clmdist(1), clm dist(1)  - compute the distance between two or more partitions (clusterings). The distance that is computed can be any of split/join distance, variance of information, or Mirkin metric. clmdist is not in actual fact a program. This manual page documents the behaviour and options of the clm program when invoked in mode dist. The options -h, --apropos, --version, -set, --nop are accessible in all clm modes. They are described in the clm manual page
fdisk(8)                 - DOS partition maintenance program
gpt(8)                   - GUID partition table maintenance utility
pdisk(8)                 - Apple partition table editor
fdisk(8)                 - DOS partition maintenance program
gpt(8)                   - GUID partition table maintenance utility
pdisk(8)                 - Apple partition table editor
(END)
```
### `whatis` - Display one-line manual page descriptions
```console
fky:~$ whatis cd
cd(n)                    - Change working directory
fky:~$ whatis mkdir
mkdir(1)                 - make directories
```
## Other helpful commands for package usage
### `--version` - Display the installed version of the package
Usually, you can use either `-v` or `--version` to display the version.
```console
fky:~$ raxml -v
This is RAxML version 8.2.12 released by Alexandros Stamatakis on May 2018.
......
fky:~$ java --version
java 15.0.2 2021-01-19
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 15.0.2+7-27)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 15.0.2+7-27, mixed mode, sharing)
```
### `alias` - Rename the package command in your system
This is for renaming the command temporarily. This will work immediately in that terminal session, but it will disappear as soon as you close the terminal or open a new one. Because aliases set this way are stored only in the memory of the current shell session. They’re not persistent.
```console
fky:~$ type ll
ll not found
fky:~$ alias ll="ls -lah"
fky:~$ type ll
ll is an alias for ls -lah
...
fky:~$ unalias ll
fky:~$ type ll
ll not found
```

> [!TIP]
> To enable the same alias every time you reboot your system, save your `alias` command in your `.zrcsh` or `.bashrc`, depending on which shell you are using. Please be very careful when you are changing your `.rc` file, because it's a critical script that runs automatically every time a new shell session starts (for interactive shells). Mistakes in this file can be disruptive to shell usage.
