# Working with with commands/tools
One of the main reason that a lot of us uses command line is to use specific packages and softwares. This section will cover some basic but useful commands while working with command line tools.

## Identifying Commands

### `type` - Display a command's type
```console
fky:~$ type ls
ls is an alias for ls -G
fky:~$ type cd
cd is a shell builtin
```
### `which` - Display an Executable's Location
```console
fky:~$ which clear
/usr/bin/clear
fky:~$ which python3
/usr/local/bin/python3
```

## Getting a Command's Documentation
### `help` - Get help from shell builtins - exclusive for linux
```console
fky:~$ help cd
```

### `--help` - Display usage information
Most tools or packages written using standard CLI frameworks automatically support `-h/--help`.
```console
fky:~$ python3 --help

usage: /usr/local/bin/python3.10 [option] ... [-c cmd | -m mod | file | -] [arg] ...
Options and arguments (and corresponding environment variables):
-b     : issue warnings about str(bytes_instance), str(bytearray_instance)
         and comparing bytes/bytearray with str. (-bb: issue errors)
-B     : don't write .pyc files on import; also PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=x
-c cmd : program passed in as string (terminates option list)
-d     : turn on parser debugging output (for experts only, only works on
         debug builds); also PYTHONDEBUG=x
-E     : ignore PYTHON* environment variables (such as PYTHONPATH)
-h     : print this help message and exit (also -? or --help)
-i     : inspect interactively after running script; forces a prompt even
         if stdin does not appear to be a terminal; also PYTHONINSPECT=x
-I     : isolate Python from the user's environment (implies -E and -s)
......
```
Other varieties of the `-h` command
```bash
<package-command> --help
<package-command> -help
<package-command> -h
```

### `man` - Display a program's manual page
```console
fky:~$ man cd
BUILTIN(1)                 General Commands Manual                BUILTIN(1)

fky:~$ man mkdir
MKDIR(1)                   General Commands Manual                  MKDIR(1)

NAME
     mkdir – make directories

SYNOPSIS
     mkdir [-pv] [-m mode] directory_name ...

DESCRIPTION
     The mkdir utility creates the directories named as operands, in the
     order specified, using mode “rwxrwxrwx” (0777) as modified by the
     current umask(2).
......
```
note - need to press `q` to quit the manual page.

Usually, either `--help` or  `man` should work for a well-packaged tool.

### `apropos` - Display appropriate commands
```console
fky:~$ apropos partition
clmdist(1), clm dist(1)  - compute the distance between two or more partitions (clusterings). The distance that is computed can be any of split/join distance, variance of information, or Mirkin metric. clmdist is not in actual fact a program. This manual page documents the behaviour and options of the clm program when invoked in mode dist. The options -h, --apropos, --version, -set, --nop are accessible in all clm modes. They are described in the clm manual page
fdisk(8)                 - DOS partition maintenance program
gpt(8)                   - GUID partition table maintenance utility
pdisk(8)                 - Apple partition table editor
fdisk(8)                 - DOS partition maintenance program
gpt(8)                   - GUID partition table maintenance utility
pdisk(8)                 - Apple partition table editor
(END)
```
### `whatis` - Display one-line manual page descriptions
```console
fky:~$ whatis cd
cd(n)                    - Change working directory
fky:~$ whatis mkdir
mkdir(1)                 - make directories
```
## Other helpful commands for package usage
### `--version` - Display the installed version of the package
Usually, you can use either `--version` or `-v` to display the version. Sometimes `-v` might mean something else in the package, e.g. in python it means verbose. `--version` is a safer choice.
```console
fky:~$ python3 --version
Python 3.13.2
......
fky:~$ java --version
java 15.0.2 2021-01-19
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 15.0.2+7-27)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 15.0.2+7-27, mixed mode, sharing)
```
### `alias` - Rename the package command in your system
This is for renaming the command temporarily. This will work immediately in that terminal session, but it will disappear as soon as you close the terminal or open a new one. Because aliases set this way are stored only in the memory of the current shell session. They’re not persistent.
```console
fky:~$ type ll
ll not found
fky:~$ alias ll="ls -lah"
fky:~$ type ll
ll is an alias for ls -lah
...
fky:~$ unalias ll
fky:~$ type ll
ll not found
```

> [!TIP]
> To enable the same alias every time you reboot your system, save your `alias` command in your `.zshrc` or `.bashrc`, depending on which shell you are using. Please be very careful when you are changing your `.rc` file, because it's a critical script that runs automatically every time a new shell session starts (for interactive shells). Mistakes in this file can be disruptive to shell usage.

# Setting Up the Environment

## What is _**shell**_?
A shell is a program that lets you interact with your computer’s operating system through commands.It's like a translator between you and the computer’s core (the kernel). You type a command → the shell interprets it → the system runs it → you see the result. The terminal/command-line we are using are a text-based interface of shell.

`Bash` stands for Bourne Again SHell. It's a command-line shell and scripting language commonly used on Linux and macOS. `zsh`is another shell, similar to Bash, commonly used on macOS.

## What is the _**environment**_?
The shell maintains a body of information during our shell session called the _**environment**_. Programs use the data stored in the environment to determine facts about the system’s configuration. While most programs use configuration files to store program settings, some programs also look for values stored in the environment to adjust their behavior. Knowing this, we can use the environment to customize our shell experience.

The shell stores two basic types of data in the environment; though, with bash, the types are largely indistinguishable. They are _**environment variables**_ and _**shell variables**_. Shell variables are bits of data placed there by bash, and environment variables are everything else. 

## Viewing shell and enviroment variables with `printenv`, `set`, and `echo`
`printenv` will only display environment variables, while `set` will display both shell and environment variables. You can see that `printenv` and `set` output different list of variables below.
```console
fky:~$ printenv
__CFBundleIdentifier=com.apple.Terminal
TMPDIR=/var/folders/44/wzzp9dzs31v_2wbx_96mn2qr0000gn/T/
XPC_FLAGS=0x0
LaunchInstanceID=905F4111-B673-4A34-90D1-35BFDD64568B
TERM=xterm-256color
DISPLAY=/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.OhmBGOCU7J/org.xquartz:0
SECURITYSESSIONID=186a2
SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/private/tmp/com.apple.launchd.Wp8d9kc6P1/Listeners
XPC_SERVICE_NAME=0
USER=fky
...
```
```console
fky:~$ set
'!'=674
'#'=0
'$'=638
'*'=(  )
-=569JNRXZghiklms
0=-zsh
'?'=0
@=(  )
ARGC=0
BG
CDPATH=''
COLUMNS=90
CONDA_DEFAULT_ENV=base
...
```
The `printenv` command can also list the value of a specific variable, but you cannot use the `set` command the same way.
```console
fky:~$ printenv USER
fky
```
It is also possible to view the contents of a variable using the echo command.
```console
fky:~$ echo $USER
fky
```

> [!TIP]
> Aliases cannot be shown by `set` or `printenv`, but you can display the list of aliases by entering the `alias` command without arguments.
```console
fky:~$ alias
-='cd -'
...=../..
....=../../..
.....=../../../..
......=../../../../..
1='cd -1'
...
```
### Other useful variables to know about:
| Variable  | Contents|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `DISPLAY`  |   The name of your display if you are running a graphical environment. Usually this is :0, meaning the first display generated by the X server.    |
| `EDITOR`  | The name of the program to be used for text editing. |
|`SHELL`| The name of your shell program. |
|`HOME`| The pathname of your home directory. |
|`LANG`| Defines the character set and collation order of your language. |
|`OLDPWD`| The previous working directory. |
|`PAGER`| The name of the program to be used for paging output. This is often set to /usr/bin/less. |
|`PATH`| A colon-separated list of directories that are searched when you enter the name of a executable program. |
|`PS1`| Stands for “prompt string 1.“ This defines the contents of the shell prompt. As we will later see, this can be extensively customized. |
|`PWD`| The current working directory. |
|`TERM`| The name of your terminal type. Unix-like systems support many terminal protocols; this variable sets the protocol to be used with your terminal emulator. |
|`TZ`| Specifies your time zone. Most Unix-like systems maintain the computer’s internal clock in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and then display the local time by applying an offset specified by this variable. |
|`USER`| Your username. |

## `PATH`
`PATH` is a colon-separated list of directories that are searched when you enter the name of a executable program. Folks frequently use `echo` to show what is in their `PATH`.
```console
fky:~$ echo $PATH
/home/fky/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/
```

What you should and should not do with `PATH`:

✅Add Custom Directories to `PATH`

If you have custom scripts or binaries, add their directory to PATH in your shell config (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, or `~/.zshrc`)

```console
fky:~$ export PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"
```
This ensures you can run your scripts from anywhere without specifying the full path.

✅ Reload Shell after modifying `PATH`
Your `PATH` variable is not updated in the shell until you reload your shell. You could check the location of your executables and `PATH` with:
```console
fky:~$ which <command_name>
fky:~$ echo $PATH
```

✅ Use Absolute Paths for System-Wide Modifications

When adding system-wide paths (e.g., in /etc/environment), always use absolute paths to avoid confusion.
> E.g. When you are in the `/Users/fky/` directory, `Desktop/` is a relative path of `/Users/fky/Desktop/`

❌ Don't Add . (Current Directory) to PATH

Adding . to PATH (or using export PATH=".:$PATH") is a security risk because a malicious script in your current directory could be executed unintentionally.

❌ Don't Make PATH Too Long

Excessively long PATH values slow down command execution and may cause conflicts.

❌ Don't Remove Essential System Directories
Never do:
```console
fky:~$ export PATH="/custom/bin"
```
This overwrites PATH, removing system directories, which can make basic commands (like ls, cd, or bash) unavailable.

## **Configuration**
When we log on to the system, the bash program starts and reads a series of configuration scripts called startup files, which define the default environment shared by all users. This is followed by more startup files in our home directory that define our personal environment. The exact sequence depends on the type of shell session being started. There are two kinds:
> **A login shell session**: This is one in which we are prompted for our username and password. This happens when we start a virtual console session (SSH or GUI terminal login), for example.

| **File**  | **Contents**|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `/etc/profile`  |   A global configuration script that applies to all users.    |
| `~/.bash_profile`  | A user’s personal startup file. It can be used to extend or override settings in the global configuration script. |
|`~/.bash_login`| If ~/.bash_profile is not found, bash attempts to read this script. |
|`~/.profile`| If neither ~/.bash_profile nor ~/.bash_login is found, bash attempts to read this file. This is the default in Debian-based distributions, such as Ubuntu. |

> **A non-login shell session**: This typically occurs when we launch a terminal session in the GUI, i.e. opening a new terminal window.

| **File**  | **Contents**|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| `/etc/bash.bashrc`  |   A global configuration script that applies to all users.    |
| `~/.bashrc`  | A user’s personal startup file. It can be used to extend or override settings in the global configuration script. |

> [!TIP]
> In addition to reading the startup files listed above, non-login shells inherit the environment from their parent process, usually a login shell. Remember because most of the filenames listed start with a period (meaning that they are hidden), we will need to use the `-a` option when using `ls`.

**Common content in `.bash_profile` file**:
 - Setting Environment Variables
 - Aliasing Commands
 - Customizing the Shell Prompt (PS1) (example?)
 - Running Other Startup Scripts (`.bash_profile` often loads `.bashrc` for consistency)
 - Setting Up a Custom PATH
 - Running Background Processes on Login
 - Custom Functions

The changes we have made to our `.bashrc` will not take effect until we close our terminal session and start a new one because the `.bashrc` file is read only at the beginning of a session. However, we can force bash to reread the modified `.bashrc` file with the following command:
```console
fky:~$ source ~/.bashrc
```

## Conda Environment

### Why `conda`?
Using `conda` in bioinformatics is highly beneficial because it simplifies package management, dependency resolution, and environment control, which are crucial in scientific computing. 
 - Conda provides a simple way to install and manage packages from channels like bioconda, which hosts thousands of bioinformatics tools.
 - Many bioinformatics tools require specific versions of dependencies. Conda allows you to create isolated environments, preventing conflicts between tools.

### Anaconda vs Miniconda

| Feature           | Anaconda                          | Miniconda                         |
|------------------|--------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Size**        | Large (~500MB)                 | Small (~40MB)                  |
| **Includes**    | Conda, Python, and 100s of preinstalled packages (NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, etc.) | Only Conda and Python (minimal setup) |
| **Best for**    | Users who want a ready-to-use data science environment | Users who prefer a lightweight setup and install packages as needed |
| **Installation Time** | Longer due to preinstalled packages | Faster due to minimal installation |
| **Flexibility**  | Less flexible (comes with many packages by default) | More flexible (you choose which packages to install) |
| **Package Management** | Uses Conda package manager | Also uses Conda package manager |
| **System Resource Usage** | Higher (more packages and dependencies) | Lower (minimal setup) |
| **Default Channels** | Defaults to Anaconda’s official repository | Defaults to Anaconda’s repository but can use other sources |
| **Usage Scenario** | Ideal for beginners or those who want a fully-featured data science environment out-of-the-box | Ideal for experienced users who want a lightweight setup and control over installed packages |

### Where to start with `conda`?
Conda is pretty straghtforward to [install](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html) and has clear, easy-to-start [tutorials](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html) on their website.

# Connecting with Remote Hosts

## What is a remote host
Unix-like operating systems have had the capability to be administered remotely via a network. This allows users to access high performance computing without physically manipulating bulky computers. Thus, access remote hosts is an essential ability to have with regards to command line.

## Checking network connection and remote host ip
8.8.8.8 is the primary IP address for Google's public DNS server. It's common to use it to check network connection in the shell.
```console
fky:~$ ping 8.8.8.8
PING 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=0 ttl=115 time=26.479 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=1 ttl=115 time=17.021 ms
64 bytes from 8.8.8.8: icmp_seq=2 ttl=115 time=194.726 ms
...
```
Do CTRL+C to interrupt this process.

You can also use `ping` to check if the ip of your server exist and that it is connected to the network.
```console
fky:~$ ping <server-ip>
PING <server-ip> (<server-ip>): 56 data bytes
64 bytes from <server-ip>: icmp_seq=0 ttl=55 time=21.033 ms
64 bytes from <server-ip>: icmp_seq=1 ttl=55 time=54.150 ms
64 bytes from <server-ip>: icmp_seq=2 ttl=55 time=23.168 ms
64 bytes from <server-ip>: icmp_seq=3 ttl=55 time=27.657 ms
...
```

## Connect to remote hosts with `ssh`
Secure Shell (SSH) is the standard command to use to connect to remote hosts. It will ask for a password for the remote host:
```console
fky:~$ ssh <username>@<server-ip>
<username>@<server-ip>'s password:
```
Example screen for a successful login
```console
fky:~$ ssh <username>@<server-ip>
<username>@<server-ip>'s password:

Part of what happens when you establish a connection with a remote host via SSH is that an encrypted tunnel is created between the local and remote systems. Then you can use the shell on the remote host like using the terminal on your local laptop.

To disconnect from the remnote host
```console
username@ubuntu22:~$ exit
logout
Connection to <server-ip> closed.
```

## `scp`
The OpenSSH package also includes programs that can make use of an SSH-encrypted tunnel to copy files across the network. `scp` (secure copy) is used much like the familiar cp program to copy files. The most notable difference is that the source or destination pathnames may be preceded with the name of a remote host, followed by a colon character.

> [!TIP]
> You cannot use `scp` when you are logged onto the remote server

Copying files from remote to local, local to remote, remote to remote, copy entire folder
```console
fky:~$ scp <username>@<server-ip>:/path_to_the_file_to_copy /path_of_the_local_folder_to_save
fky:~$ scp -r <username>@<server-ip>:/path_to_the_folder_to_copy /path_of_the_local_folder_to_save
fky:~$ scp -r <username>@<server-ip>:/path_to_the_folder_to_copy /path_of_the_local_folder_to_save
```

**Other commonly used options of `scp`**
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-r`   | Recursively copy directories and their contents. |
| `-C`   | Enable compression for faster transfers. |
| `-v`   | Enable verbose output to debug connection issues. |
| `-q`   | Suppress non-error output (quiet mode). |
| `-l`   | Limit bandwidth usage in Kbit/s (e.g., `-l 1000`). |
| `-p`   | Preserve file attributes such as timestamps and permissions. |
| `-B`   | Run in batch mode, preventing password prompts. |

## `rsync`
Similar to `scp`, `rsync` is a fast and versatile file-copying tool commonly used for synchronizing files and directories between local and remote systems. It minimizes data transfer by only copying differences between source and destination.

It is commonly used for backups, incremental file transfers, and efficient remote synchronization.

```console
fky:~$ rsync -avz file.txt <username>@<server-ip>:/path_to_the_file_to_copy
```
**Commonly used options of `rsync`**
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-a`   | Archive mode (preserves symbolic links, permissions, timestamps, etc.). |
| `-v`   | Verbose output (shows detailed progress). |
| `-z`   | Enable compression to speed up transfers. |
| `-r`   | Recursively copy directories (included in `-a`). |
| `-P`   | Show progress and resume interrupted transfers. |
| `--progress` | Display real-time transfer progress. |
| `-e "ssh"` | Use SSH for secure file transfers. |
| `--delete` | Delete files in the destination that no longer exist in the source. |
| `--exclude="pattern"` | Exclude files matching a pattern (e.g., `--exclude="*.log"`). |
| `--include="pattern"` | Include specific files in transfer despite exclusions. |
| `--dry-run` | Show what would happen without actually copying files. |
| `-n`   | Alias for `--dry-run`. |
| `-u`   | Skip files that are newer in the destination. |
| `--bwlimit=RATE` | Limit bandwidth usage (e.g., `--bwlimit=1000` for 1MB/s). |
| `--checksum` | Compare files using checksums instead of timestamps. |

## Compare `scp` and `rsync`

| Feature         | `rsync` | `scp` |
|---------------|--------|------|
| **Transfer Method** | Uses **delta transfer** (only transfers changed parts of files). | Transfers **entire files** every time. |
| **Speed Efficiency** | Faster for repeated transfers due to incremental copying. | Slower as it copies everything, even unchanged files. |
| **Preserving Metadata** | Preserves file attributes (`-a` for archive mode). | Partially preserves timestamps and permissions (`-p`). |
| **Resuming Transfers** | Can resume interrupted transfers (`-P` or `--partial`). | Cannot resume; must restart the transfer. |
| **Progress Display** | Can show detailed progress (`--progress`). | No built-in progress display. |
| **Exclusion Rules** | Allows excluding specific files or directories (`--exclude`). | No built-in exclusion support. |
| **Syncing Files** | Deletes destination files that don’t exist in the source (`--delete`). | Only copies; does not sync differences. |
| **Usage Scenario** | Best for **backups, syncing directories, and large file transfers**. | Best for **simple, one-time file transfers**. |

## Downloading files from the web and FTP sites with `wget`
Single files, multiple files, and even entire sites can be downloaded with `wget`.
```console
fky:~$ wget --help
GNU Wget 1.25.0, a non-interactive network retriever.
Usage: wget [OPTION]... [URL]...

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.

Startup:
  -V,  --version                   display the version of Wget and exit
  -h,  --help                      print this help
  -b,  --background                go to background after startup
  -e,  --execute=COMMAND           execute a `.wgetrc'-style command

Logging and input file:
