### Now that you've opened your terminal..
Try typing or copying and pasting these lines into the terminal window.
```
STR="Hello world!"
echo $STR
```
This step sets the variable called `STR` to equal (`=`) the string of characters `Hello world!`. Then, we can `echo` the contents of this variable by using `$` to specify that we are calling a variable. 
* What happens if you put other text into `STR`?
* Try setting a different variable like `NAME`?
* What happens if you forget to use `$`?
